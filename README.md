## Setup

## Why?
This repo is for my personal goal to get familiarized with creating complex backends that require and use a middleware, module, and routes. This will separate different logic to make the infrastructure of the code readable, manageable, and efficient.
I hope to come out with a better insight on how to write and improve backend code for myself and the company I work for.
